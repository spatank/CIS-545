Upsampling is backwards strided convolution</p>\\n  \\n  <p>Another way to connect coarse outputs to dense pixels\\n  is interpolation. For instance, simple bilinear interpolation\\n  computes each output $y_{ij}$ from the nearest four inputs by a\\n  linear map that depends only on the relative positions of the\\n  input and output cells.<br/>\\n  In a sense, upsampling with factor $f$ is convolution with\\n  a fractional input stride of 1/f. So long as $f$ is integral, a\\n  natural way to upsample is therefore backwards convolution\\n  (sometimes called deconvolution) with an output stride of\\n  $f$. Such an operation is trivial to implement, since it simply\\n  reverses the forward and backward passes of convolution.<br/>\\n  Thus upsampling is performed in-network for end-to-end\\n  learning by backpropagation from the pixelwise loss.<br/>\\n  Note that the deconvolution filter in such a layer need not\\n  be fixed (e.g., to bilinear upsampling), but can be learned.\\n  A stack of deconvolution layers and activation functions can\\n  even learn a nonlinear upsampling.<br/>\\n  In our experiments, we find that in-network upsampling\\n  is fast and effective for learning dense prediction. Our best\\n  segmentation architecture uses these layers to learn to upsample\\n  for refined prediction in Section 4.2.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>I don\\'t think I really understood how convolutional layers are trained. </p>\\n\\n<p>What I think I\\'ve understood is that convolutional layers with a kernel size $k$ learn filters of size $k \\\\times k$. The output of a convolutional layer with kernel size $k$, stride $s \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}$ and $n$ filters is of dimension $\\\\frac{\\\\text{Input dim}}{s^2} \\\\cdot n$. However, I don\\'t know how the learning of convolutional layers works. (I understand how simple MLPs learn with gradient descent, if that helps).</p>\\n\\n<p>So if my understanding of convolutional layers is correct, I have no clue how this can be reversed.</p>\\n\\n<p>Could anybody please help me to understand deconvolutional layers?</p>\\n'"

              "'I recently read Fully Convolutional Networks for Semantic Segmentation by Jonathan Long, Evan Shelhamer, Trevor Darrell. I don\\'t understand what \"deconvolutional layers\" do / how they work.The relevant part is  3.3. Upsampling is backwards strided convolution    Another way to connect coarse outputs to dense pixels  is interpolation. For instance, simple bilinear interpolation  computes each output  from the nearest four inputs by a  linear map that depends only on the relative positions of the  input and output cells.  In a sense, upsampling with factor  is convolution with  a fractional input stride of 1/f. So long as  is integral, a  natural way to upsample is therefore backwards convolution  (sometimes called deconvolution) with an output stride of  . Such an operation is trivial to implement, since it simply  reverses the forward and backward passes of convolution.  Thus upsampling is performed in-network for end-to-end  learning by backpropagation from the pixelwise loss.  Note that the deconvolution filter in such a layer need not  be fixed (e.g., to bilinear upsampling), but can be learned.  A stack of deconvolution layers and activation functions can  even learn a nonlinear upsampling.  In our experiments, we find that in-network upsampling  is fast and effective for learning dense prediction. Our best  segmentation architecture uses these layers to learn to upsample  for refined prediction in Section 4.2.I don\\'t think I really understood how convolutional layers are trained. What I think I\\'ve understood is that convolutional layers with a kernel size  learn filters of size . The output of a convolutional layer with kernel size , stride  and  filters is of dimension . However, I don\\'t know how the learning of convolutional layers works. (I understand how simple MLPs learn with gradient descent, if that helps).So if my understanding of convolutional layers is correct, I have no clue how this can be reversed.Could anybody please help me to understand deconvolutional layers?'"

        "Now that you've seen how to run SQL queries through pandas, we'll working with running SQL in Apache Spark! Apache Spark is a complex, cluster-based data processing system written in Scala used for big data processing. For the most part, Spark interfaces “smoothly” to Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "While Spark dataframes try to emulate the same programming style as Pandas DataFrames, there are some differences in how you express things. Please refer to the Lecture Slides or the following resources to learn about these differences:\n",

        "\n",
        "For this assignment, we are going to get familiar with Spark without worrying too much about sharding and distribution. This isn’t really using it to its strengths -- and in fact you might find Spark to be slow -- but it will get you comfortable with programming in Spark without worrying about distributed nodes, clusters, and spending real dollars on the cloud. For Homework 3, we’ll connect your Jupyter instance to Spark running on the cloud.\n",

        "### Initializing a Connection to Spark\n",
